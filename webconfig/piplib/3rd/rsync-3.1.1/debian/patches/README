These are the main patches to the rsync source.
(The changes to the manpages for correct hyphens
and quotes is a bit big, so not included.)

If you're wondering about the lack of patches, the
explanation is that upstream has adopted most of them :-)

CVE-2014-9512.diff	- prevent path spoofing attack vulnerability
			  (the original git diff is modified to update NEWS
			  cleanly)
logdir.diff             - fix the location of the logdir
ssh-6-option.diff       - call ssh with -6 option if rsync was called with -6,
                          ditto with -4
noatime.diff		- add an option --noatime to request the kernel not to
			  update files' access times while reading them. See
			  https://bugzilla.samba.org/show_bug.cgi?id=7249#c5
